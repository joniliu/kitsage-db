BNT162,mRNA-based vaccine,"<strong>Background</strong>: Pfizer and BioNtech are&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005943/en/"">collaborating</a>&nbsp;to develop BNT162, a series of vaccine candidates for COVID-19. BNT162 was initially four candidates developed by BioNTech, two candidates consisting of nucleoside modified mRNA-based (modRNA), one of uridine containing mRNA-based (uRNA), and the fourth candidate of self-amplifying mRNA-based (saRNA). Pre-clinical results of the modRNA candidate BNT162b2&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.280818v1"">posted</a>&nbsp;to the pre-print server&nbsp;<em>bioRxiv</em>&nbsp;showed the vaccine had &quot;protective anti-viral effects in rhesus macaques, with concomitant high neutralizing antibody titers and a TH1-biased cellular response in rhesus macaques and mice.&quot; The companies have selected BNT162b2 to move forward in a Phase 2/3 trial.<br />
<br />
<strong>Study Designs:</strong>&nbsp;A Phase 1/2 trial in the US and Germany of 200 healthy participants between aged 18-55 years, with a vaccine dose range of 1 &micro;g to 100 &micro;g is currently recruiting (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04380701"">NCT04380701</a>) as is a Phase 2/3 trial of about 32,000 healthy participants&nbsp;(<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728"">NCT04368728</a>) Pfizer and BioNTech are also&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-pfizer-japan/pfizer-biontech-start-combined-trials-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-in-japan-idUSKBN2750KF"">planning</a>&nbsp;a combined Phase 1/2 trial of 160 participants between 20-85 years old (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04588480"">NCT04588480</a>).<br />
<br />
<strong>Outcomes:</strong> On 9 November, Pfizer and BioNTech&nbsp;<a href=""https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against-covid-19"">announced</a>&nbsp;interim results by press release of 94 Phase 3 trial participants, which showed BNT162b2 was more than 90% effective in protecting participants who had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days after the second dose. Those results are backed up by Phase 1&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027906"">data</a>&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>&nbsp;showing similar immunogenicity between BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 but fewer adverse effects with BNT162b2. Another study of Phase 1/2 data for BNT162b1 was&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4"">published</a>&nbsp;in the journal&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>. Robust immunogenicity was seen after vaccination at all three doses (10 &mu;g, 30 &mu;g and 100 &mu;g). Adverse events were elevated at the highest dose; therefore, participants did not receive a second dose at that level. Participants in Phase 1/2 trials who received two doses between 1 and 50 &micro;g of BNT162b1 had &quot;robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses,&quot; according to a paper&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2814-7"">published</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;on 30 September.<br />

mRNA-1273,mRNA-based vaccine,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: mRNA-1273 was developed by Moderna based on prior studies of related coronaviruses such as those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).<br /> <br /> <strong>Study Design</strong>: A Phase 3 trial of 30,000 participants at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection is underway. Participants will receive a 100 &micro;g dose of mRNA-1273 or placebo and then be&nbsp;followed for up to 2 years (COVE trial;&nbsp;<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427"">NCT04470427</a>). Moderna&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.modernatx.com/cove-study"">posted</a>&nbsp;the full trial protocol for COVE on 17 September. Previously, a Phase 1 trial (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04283461?term=mrna-1273&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"">NCT04283461</a>) of 105 healthy participants provided the basis for Moderna&rsquo;s investigational new drug application (<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200427005839/en/Moderna-Announces-IND-Submitted-U.S.-FDA-Phase"">IND</a>), which was successfully reviewed by the FDA and set the stage for Phase 2 testing. A Phase 2 trial of 600 healthy participants evaluating 25 &micro;g, 100 &micro;g, and 250 &micro;g dose levels of the vaccine was completed.&nbsp;<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04405076"">(NCT04405076)</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Outcomes</strong>:<br /> Human studies - An&nbsp;<a href=""https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy"">interim analysis</a> of 95 participants in the Phase 3 COVE trial was released by Moderna on 16 November. The non-peer-reviewed data indicate mRNA-1273 has an efficacy of 94.5%. There were no severe cases of COVID-19 in the vaccinated group compared with 11 cases in the placebo group. Overall, the company said the vaccine was tolerated well with no &ldquo;significant safety concerns.&rdquo; Additionally, Phase 1 data&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home"">published</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>&nbsp;showed mRNA-1273 successfully produced neutralizing antibody titers in 8 participants who received either 25 &micro;g or 100 &micro;g doses. The response was dose dependent in 45 participants across 25 &micro;g, 100 &micro;g, and 250 &micro;g dose levels. In participants with available antibody data, neutralizing antibody titers were on par with what has been seen in convalescent sera from people who have successfully fought off COVID-19. The vaccine also appears to be safe for older adults, with participants who received two 25 &mu;g or 100 &mu;g doses of the vaccine experiencing mild or moderate effects consisting of fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and injection site pain, according to data from the Phase 1 trial&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2028436"">published</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.<br /> <br /> Animal studies - Results from a challenge in a mouse model showed mRNA-1273 prevented viral replication in the lungs, and neutralizing titers in the mouse model were similar in participants receiving 25 &micro;g or 100 &micro;g doses of the vaccine.
