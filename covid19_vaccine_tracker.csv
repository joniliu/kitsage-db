Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine,Live-attenuated vaccine,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: The BCG vaccine is indicated to prevent tuberculosis in those who have a higher risk of the disease. It has been implicated in helping to combat other infections outside TB by boosting the immune system to fight similar infections. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/1_BCG_report_revised_version_online.pdf"">reported</a>&nbsp;the BCG vaccine may be effective against leprosy and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as buruli ulcer disease.

A non-peer reviewed paper posted in March 2020 on the preprint server <i>medRxiv</i> has suggested countries with BCG vaccination programs at childhood are&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v1"">faring better</a>&nbsp;in the fight against COVID-19 compared with countries that do not require BCG vaccination. <br /><br /><strong>Trials</strong>: BCG vaccines are being studied in the randomized, controlled, Phase 3 <a href=""https://www.mcri.edu.au/BRACE"">BRACE</a> trial, which aims to recruit 4,170 healthcare workers in hospitals in Australia (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04327206"">NCT04327206</a>). Researchers in The Netherlands launched the randomized, parallel-assignment, phase 3 BCG-CORONA trial on 31 March and plan to enroll 1,500 healthcare workers to receive the BCG vaccine or placebo (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04328441"">NCT04328441</a>). The Faustman Lab is currently evaluating the BCG vaccine&rsquo;s effectiveness in&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.faustmanlab.org/clinical-trials/#diabetes"">type 1 diabetes</a>&nbsp;and is seeking funding to launch a trial to assess whether the vaccine helps prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers, according to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/health/coronavirus-bcg-vaccine.html"">independent reporting</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. <br /><br /><strong>Outcomes</strong>: A <a href=""https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/32/eabc1463"">paper</a> published in <i>Science Advances</i> found countries that required BCG vaccination until the year 2000 had significantly slower growth rates of COVID-19 compared with countries that did not mandate the vaccine. In <i>The Journal of Clinical Investigation</i> published in November 2020, researchers <a href=""https://www.jci.org/articles/view/145157"">found</a> healthcare workers with the BCG vaccine had ""decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms."" However, a birth cohort study published in <i>Clinical Infectious Diseases</i> <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1223/5896039"">found</a> the BCG tuberculosis vaccine did not have a protective effect against COVID-19 in more than 1 million individuals born in Sweden who received the vaccine.
