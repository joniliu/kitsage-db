Sputnik Light,Recombinant adenovirus vaccine (rAd26),"<p><strong>Background</strong>: The Gamaleya Research Institute in Russia and the Health Ministry of the Russian Federation have developed a heterologic recombinant adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccine called Sputnik Light. Sputnik Light is the first component of Gamaleya's Sputnik V vaccine, which uses the Ad26 vector.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Regulatory Actions</strong>:<br />Sputnik Light has been authorized for use in Angola, Bahrain, and Russia. The vaccine was approved while still being evaluated in clinical trials.<br /><br /><strong>Trials</strong>:&nbsp;<br />A Phase 1/2 trial of up to 110 participants in Russia assessing safety and tolerability is active but not recruiting (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04713488"">NCT04713488</a>). A Phase 3 trial of up to 6,000 participants currently is underway (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04741061"">NCT04741061</a>). <br /><br /><strong>Outcomes</strong>:<br />Gamaleya has <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/sputnik-light-russia-authorizes-use-of-one-shot-covid-vaccine.html"">reported</a> the vaccine's efficacy is 79.4%.

COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (JNJ-78436735; Ad26.COV2.S),Non-replicating viral vector,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: Janssen Biotech, a company owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, has developed COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (formerly JNJ-78436735 and Ad26.COV2.S), a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, using their AdVac and PER.C6 systems, which were also used to develop the company's Ebola vaccine. COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is a part of Operation Warp Speed.<br /><br /><strong>Status:&nbsp;</strong>In April 2021, reports began circulating of very rare instances (6 cases out of 6.8 million vaccinated individuals) of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and thrombocytopenia after receiving COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. On 13 April, the FDA and CDC <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine"">recommended</a> that administration of the vaccine be paused in the US while reports were investigated. The CDC's ACIP <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/health/cdc-jj-vaccine.html"">met</a> on 14 April and deferred a vote on a recommendation until more data were collected; the FDA and CDC <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-and-cdc-lift-recommended-pause-johnson-johnson-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-use-following-thorough"">lifted</a> the pause on the vaccine after a second ACIP meeting on 23 April. On 20 April, EMA <a href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood"">recommended</a> the product information for the Janssen vaccine should be updated to include a ""warning about unusual blood clots with low blood platelets"" and list it as a rare event. On 7 May, EMA&rsquo;s safety committee (PRAC) concluded their review and reconfirmed that the benefits outweigh the risks for the vaccine.<br /><br />Some countries decided individually to pause their rollouts, including <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-safrica/south-africa-suspends-jj-vaccine-rollout-after-u-s-pause-idUSKBN2C02HT"">South Africa</a>, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-vaccine/sweden-pauses-plans-for-jj-covid-19-vaccinations-awaits-review-idUSKBN2C11UW"">Sweden</a>, and <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-france-johnson-joh/france-says-to-administer-jj-covid-19-vaccine-as-planned-idUSKBN2C11X0"">France</a>. <span>A correspondence to the editor, <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2106075"">published</a> in <em>NEJM</em> by staff physicians at Janssen, said that ""evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between these events and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine."" A case report series <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779731"">published</a> in&nbsp;<em>JAMA</em> identified 12 cases of CVST in the US, labeling them as ""serious events.""

CoronaVac,Inactivated vaccine (formalin with alum adjuvant),"<p><strong>Background</strong>: CoronaVac (formerly PiCoVacc) is a formalin-inactivated and alum-adjuvanted vaccine developed by the China-based biotechnology company Sinovac Biotech. The vaccine is administered in two doses 14-28 days apart. <br /><br /><strong>Regulatory Actions</strong>: <br />- WHO: <a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/01-06-2021-who-validates-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use-and-issues-interim-policy-recommendations"">Granted</a> an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 1 June.<br />- China: On 4 June, CoronaVac was <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/05/china-approves-sinovac-covid-vaccine-for-emergency-use-in-children-teens.html"">approved</a> for use in children and adolescents between 3-17 years of age.<br />- European Union: EMA <a href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-covid-19-vaccine-vero-cell-inactivated"">started</a> a rolling review of CoronaVac on 4 May.<br />- South Africa: SAHPRA <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-safrica-sinovac/south-africas-drugs-regulator-to-start-assessing-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN2B40OP"">began</a> a review of the vaccine on 12 March.<br /><br />Many countries have now authorized or approved CoronaVac for emergency use. Please see the Authorization/Approval column for hyperlinks to each individual country's announcement.<br /><br /><strong>Trials:</strong> Several large international trials including Phase 3 trials with the Instituto Butantan in Brazil (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04456595"">NCT04456595</a>), <a href=""https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/sinovac-commences-phase-iii-clinical-trials-for-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-in-turkey/"">Turkey</a> (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04582344"">NCT04582344</a>) and Indonesia (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04508075"">NCT04508075</a>), and a trial of up to 9,000 patients in the healthcare industry. Previously, Sinovac launched a Phase 1/2 trial of 743 healthy volunteers and a Phase 1 trial of 143 participants (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04352608"">NCT04352608</a>) and a Phase 2 trial of 600 participants (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04383574"">NCT04383574</a>). <br /><br />There has been variation in the vaccine's efficacy across clinical trials. Preliminary results from the Instituto Butantan trial <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sinovac-brazil/chinas-sinovac-vaccine-is-safe-brazil-institute-says-idUSKBN27429E"">announced</a> by the company indicate CoronaVac is safe so far, with no serious adverse events reported. The effectiveness of the vaccine has varied by region. In Phase 3 trials, efficacy is <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/sinovacs-covid-19-vaccine-shown-to-be-effective-in-brazil-trials-11608581330"">above 50%</a>, according to independent reporting from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Estimates of efficacy from trials in Brazil were originally at 78% but were <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55642648"">revised</a> to 50.4% after including patients with mild infections. An <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-sinovac/sinovac-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-more-effective-with-longer-dosing-interval-idUSKBN29N141"">announcement</a> made on 18 January indicated spreading out the dosing interval may increase the effectiveness of the vaccine by as much as 20 percentage points. According to officials in <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/turkish-official-coronavac-vaccine-9125-effective-74899577"">Turkey</a>, the effectiveness of the vaccine is 91.25%; however, the effectiveness was <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-turkey-sinovac/turkish-study-revises-down-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-to-83-5-idUSKBN2AV13A"">decreased</a> to 83.5% in a final analysis.
